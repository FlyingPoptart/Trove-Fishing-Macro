Please note that for the program to run properly, the code must be modified upon each instance of Trove.
On the line "Pointer := ReadMemory(0x05D3639C,"Trove")", replace "0x05D3639C" with the designated memory address as acquired from cheat engine.
To obtain the designated memory address, launch cheat engine. Our objective is to narrow down all the memory addresses to that which corresponds to the state of whether the fishing float is bobbing up and down. Start fishing in Trove. When the fishing float is not bobbing up and down, in cheat engine search for values of 0. When the fishing float is bobbing up and down, search for values of 1. Repeat until there is only a few (i.e. 10-100) values. Then, copy and paste the correct memory address into the code. Then, make sure AutoHotKey is installed, and run fishingMacro.ahk. Make sure num lock is off. Ingame, stand near a body of water and press 0 on the numpad of your keyboard.
Again, please note that this memory address changes upon each launch of Trove, meaning that the process must be repeated if Trove is closed.
